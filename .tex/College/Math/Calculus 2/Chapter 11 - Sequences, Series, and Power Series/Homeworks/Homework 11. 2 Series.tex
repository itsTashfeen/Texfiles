\section{Comprehensive Introduction, Context, and Prerequisites}

\subsection{Core Concepts}
An \textbf{infinite series} is, at its core, the idea of adding up the terms of an infinite sequence. While a \textbf{sequence} is a list of numbers in a specific order, $\{a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots, a_n, \dots\}$, a \textbf{series} is the sum of those numbers, $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \dots$.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sigma Notation:} We denote a series using sigma notation:
    \[ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \dots \]
    \item \textbf{Partial Sums:} Since we cannot add infinitely many numbers in a literal sense, we analyze the series by looking at its \textbf{sequence of partial sums}, denoted $\{s_n\}$. The $n$-th partial sum is the sum of the first $n$ terms of the series:
    \[ s_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i = a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n \]
    \item \textbf{Convergence and Divergence:} An infinite series is said to \textbf{converge} if its sequence of partial sums $\{s_n\}$ converges to a finite limit. If this limit is $S$, we call $S$ the \textbf{sum} of the series.
    \[ S = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} s_n \]
    If the sequence of partial sums does not converge to a finite limit (i.e., it approaches $\pm\infty$ or oscillates), the series is said to \textbf{diverge}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Intuition and Derivation}
The central idea is extending the concept of a limit to an infinite sum. How can adding infinitely many positive numbers result in a finite sum? The classic example is Zeno's Paradox: To walk across a room, you must first walk half the distance, then half the remaining distance, then half of what's left, and so on. This creates the series:
\[ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} + \dots \]
Let's look at the partial sums:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $s_1 = 1/2$
    \item $s_2 = 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4$
    \item $s_3 = 3/4 + 1/8 = 7/8$
    \item $s_n = (2^n - 1) / 2^n = 1 - 1/2^n$
\end{itemize}
The "sum" of the series is the limit of these partial sums as $n \to \infty$:
\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} s_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} (1 - \frac{1}{2^n}) = 1 - 0 = 1 \]
So, while you take an infinite number of steps, the total distance converges to 1 (the full length of the room). The "why" is that the terms we are adding, $a_n$, must get small "fast enough" for their cumulative sum to approach a ceiling. This limiting process is the rigorous mathematical tool that allows us to find a finite value for an infinite process.

\subsection{Historical Context and Motivation}
The concept of infinite series has roots in antiquity, most famously with the paradoxes of the Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea around 450 BC. His paradoxes, like Achilles and the Tortoise, questioned the nature of infinity and motion, highlighting the conceptual difficulties in summing an infinite number of terms. For centuries, mathematicians struggled with these ideas.

It wasn't until the 17th century, with the development of calculus, that significant progress was made. Mathematicians like Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz used infinite series extensively, particularly for representing functions (what we now call power series). However, their use was often informal and lacked rigor. A key breakthrough came in the 14th century when Nicole Oresme proved the divergence of the harmonic series ($1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + \dots$), a surprising result showing that even if the terms go to zero, the sum can still be infinite. The modern, rigorous treatment of series convergence was finally established in the 19th century by mathematicians like Augustin-Louis Cauchy and Karl Weierstrass, who formalized the concept of the limit, placing the entire theory on a solid logical foundation.

\subsection{Key Formulas}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Sum of a Series:} The sum $S$ is the limit of the sequence of partial sums $s_n$.
    \[ S = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} s_n \]
    \item \textbf{Geometric Series:} A series of the form $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} ar^{n-1} = a + ar + ar^2 + \dots$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It \textbf{converges} to the sum $S = \frac{a}{1-r}$ if the common ratio $|r| < 1$.
        \item It \textbf{diverges} if $|r| \ge 1$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Test for Divergence:} If the terms of the series do not approach zero, the series must diverge.
    \[ \text{If } \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n \neq 0 \text{ or the limit does not exist, then } \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n \text{ diverges.} \]
    \textbf{Warning:} The converse is false. If $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 0$, the test is inconclusive; the series might converge or diverge (e.g., the harmonic series).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Detailed Homework Solutions}

\subsection*{1. (a) What is the difference between a sequence and a series?}
\textbf{Solution:} A sequence is an ordered list of numbers, e.g., $\{a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots\}$. A series is the sum of the terms of a sequence, e.g., $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \dots$.

\subsection*{(b) What is a convergent series? What is a divergent series?}
\textbf{Solution:} A series is convergent if its sequence of partial sums $\{s_n\}$ converges to a finite limit. The limit is called the sum of the series. A series is divergent if its sequence of partial sums does not have a finite limit.

\subsection*{2. Explain what it means to say that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n = 5$.}
\textbf{Solution:} This means that the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n$ is convergent and its sum is 5. More precisely, if $s_n = a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n$ is the $n$-th partial sum, then the limit of the sequence of partial sums is 5. That is, $\lim_{n \to \infty} s_n = 5$.

\subsection*{3. Calculate the sum of the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n$ whose partial sums are given by $s_n = 2 - 3(0.8)^n$.}
\textbf{Solution:} The sum of the series is the limit of its partial sums as $n \to \infty$.
\[ S = \lim_{n \to \infty} s_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(2 - 3(0.8)^n\right) \]
Since $0 < 0.8 < 1$, we know that $\lim_{n \to \infty} (0.8)^n = 0$.
\[ S = 2 - 3(0) = 2 \]
\textbf{Final Answer:} The sum of the series is 2.

\subsection*{4. Calculate the sum of the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n$ whose partial sums are given by $s_n = \frac{n^2 - 1}{4n^2 + 1}$.}
\textbf{Solution:} The sum of the series is the limit of its partial sums as $n \to \infty$.
\[ S = \lim_{n \to \infty} s_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n^2 - 1}{4n^2 + 1} \]
To evaluate the limit, we divide the numerator and denominator by the highest power of $n$, which is $n^2$.
\[ S = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\frac{n^2}{n^2} - \frac{1}{n^2}}{\frac{4n^2}{n^2} + \frac{1}{n^2}} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1 - \frac{1}{n^2}}{4 + \frac{1}{n^2}} \]
As $n \to \infty$, $1/n^2 \to 0$.
\[ S = \frac{1 - 0}{4 + 0} = \frac{1}{4} \]
\textbf{Final Answer:} The sum of the series is $1/4$.

\subsection*{5. Calculate the first eight terms of the sequence of partial sums for $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^3}$. Does it appear the series is convergent or divergent?}
\textbf{Solution:}
$s_1 = 1/1^3 = 1.0000$ \\
$s_2 = 1 + 1/2^3 = 1 + 1/8 = 1.1250$ \\
$s_3 = 1.1250 + 1/3^3 = 1.1250 + 1/27 \approx 1.1620$ \\
$s_4 = 1.1620 + 1/4^3 = 1.1620 + 1/64 \approx 1.1777$ \\
$s_5 = 1.1777 + 1/5^3 = 1.1777 + 1/125 \approx 1.1857$ \\

$s_7 = 1.1903 + 1/7^3 = 1.1903 + 1/343 \approx 1.1932$ \\
$s_8 = 1.1932 + 1/8^3 = 1.1932 + 1/512 \approx 1.1952$ \\
The sequence of partial sums appears to be increasing but leveling off, suggesting that the series is \textbf{convergent}.

$s_2 = 1 + 1/\sqrt[3]{2} \approx 1 + 0.7937 = 1.7937$ \\
$s_3 = 1.7937 + 1/\sqrt[3]{3} \approx 1.7937 + 0.6934 = 2.4871$ \\
$s_4 = 2.4871 + 1/\sqrt[3]{4} \approx 2.4871 + 0.6300 = 3.1171$ \\
$s_5 = 3.1171 + 1/\sqrt[3]{5} \approx 3.1171 + 0.5848 = 3.7019$ \\
$s_6 = 3.7019 + 1/\sqrt[3]{6} \approx 3.7019 + 0.5503 = 4.2522$ \\
$s_7 = 4.2522 + 1/\sqrt[3]{7} \approx 4.2522 + 0.5228 = 4.7750$ \\
$s_8 = 4.7750 + 1/\sqrt[3]{8} = 4.7750 + 0.5 = 5.2750$ \\
The sequence of partial sums is increasing and does not appear to be leveling off. The series appears to be \textbf{divergent}.

\subsection*{7. Calculate the first eight terms of the sequence of partial sums for $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \sin n$. Does it appear the series is convergent or divergent?}
\textbf{Solution:}
$s_1 = \sin(1) \approx 0.8415$ \\
$s_2 = \sin(1) + \sin(2) \approx 0.8415 + 0.9093 = 1.7508$ \\
$s_3 = 1.7508 + \sin(3) \approx 1.7508 + 0.1411 = 1.8919$ \\
$s_4 = 1.8919 + \sin(4) \approx 1.8919 - 0.7568 = 1.1351$ \\
$s_5 = 1.1351 + \sin(5) \approx 1.1351 - 0.9589 = 0.1762$ \\
$s_6 = 0.1762 + \sin(6) \approx 0.1762 - 0.2794 = -0.1032$ \\
$s_7 = -0.1032 + \sin(7) \approx -0.1032 + 0.6570 = 0.5538$ \\
$s_8 = 0.5538 + \sin(8) \approx 0.5538 + 0.9894 = 1.5432$ \\
The sequence of partial sums oscillates and does not approach a single value. The series appears to be \textbf{divergent}.

\subsection*{8. Calculate the first eight terms of the sequence of partial sums for $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^n n$. Does it appear the series is convergent or divergent?}
\textbf{Solution:}
$s_1 = (-1)^1(1) = -1$ \\
$s_2 = -1 + (-1)^2(2) = -1 + 2 = 1$ \\
$s_3 = 1 + (-1)^3(3) = 1 - 3 = -2$ \\
$s_4 = -2 + (-1)^4(4) = -2 + 4 = 2$ \\
$s_5 = 2 + (-1)^5(5) = 2 - 5 = -3$ \\
$s_6 = -3 + (-1)^6(6) = -3 + 6 = 3$ \\
$s_7 = 3 + (-1)^7(7) = 3 - 7 = -4$ \\
$s_8 = -4 + (-1)^8(8) = -4 + 8 = 4$ \\
The sequence of partial sums, $\{-1, 1, -2, 2, -3, 3, \dots\}$, oscillates with increasing magnitude. It does not approach a finite limit. The series is \textbf{divergent}.

\subsection*{9. Calculate the first eight terms for $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^4+n^2}$}
\textbf{Solution:}
$s_1 = 1/(1+1) = 0.5000$ \\
$s_2 = 0.5 + 1/(16+4) = 0.5 + 0.05 = 0.5500$ \\
$s_3 = 0.55 + 1/(81+9) = 0.55 + 1/90 \approx 0.5611$ \\
$s_4 = 0.5611 + 1/(256+16) \approx 0.5611 + 0.0037 = 0.5648$ \\
$s_5 = 0.5648 + 1/(625+25) \approx 0.5648 + 0.0015 = 0.5663$ \\
$s_6 = 0.5663 + 1/(1296+36) \approx 0.5663 + 0.0008 = 0.5671$ \\
$s_7 = 0.5671 + 1/(2401+49) \approx 0.5671 + 0.0004 = 0.5675$ \\
$s_8 = 0.5675 + 1/(4096+64) \approx 0.5675 + 0.0002 = 0.5677$ \\
The sequence of partial sums appears to be increasing and leveling off. The series appears to be \textbf{convergent}.

\subsection*{10. Calculate the first eight terms for $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n!}$}
\textbf{Solution:}
$s_1 = 1/1! = 1.0000$ \\
$s_2 = 1 - 1/2! = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5000$ \\
$s_3 = 0.5 + 1/3! = 0.5 + 1/6 \approx 0.6667$ \\
$s_4 = 0.6667 - 1/4! = 0.6667 - 1/24 \approx 0.6250$ \\
$s_5 = 0.6250 + 1/5! = 0.6250 + 1/120 \approx 0.6333$ \\
$s_6 = 0.6333 - 1/6! = 0.6333 - 1/720 \approx 0.6319$ \\
$s_7 = 0.6319 + 1/7! = 0.6319 + 1/5040 \approx 0.6321$ \\
$s_8 = 0.6321 - 1/8! = 0.6321 - 1/40320 \approx 0.6321$ \\
The partial sums appear to be oscillating but homing in on a value around 0.632. The series appears to be \textbf{convergent}.

\subsection*{11. For $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{6}{(-3)^n}$, find 10 partial sums, graph, and determine if it converges.}
\textbf{Solution:}
This is a geometric series. We can write $a_n = \frac{6}{(-3)^n} = 6 \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)^n$.
The first term is $a = a_1 = 6(-1/3) = -2$. The common ratio is $r = -1/3$.
Since $|r| = |-1/3| = 1/3 < 1$, the series is convergent.
The sum is $S = \frac{a}{1-r} = \frac{-2}{1 - (-1/3)} = \frac{-2}{1 + 1/3} = \frac{-2}{4/3} = -2 \cdot \frac{3}{4} = -\frac{3}{2}$.
\textbf{Final Answer:} Convergent, sum is $-3/2$.

\subsection*{12. For $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \cos n$, find 10 partial sums, graph, and determine if it converges.}
\textbf{Solution:}
We evaluate the limit of the terms: $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} \cos n$.
The cosine function oscillates between -1 and 1 and does not approach a single value as $n \to \infty$. Thus, the limit does not exist.
By the Test for Divergence, since $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n \neq 0$, the series diverges.
\textbf{Final Answer:} Divergent.

\subsection*{13. For $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{n}{\sqrt{n^2+4}}$, find 10 partial sums, graph, and determine if it converges.}
\textbf{Solution:}
We use the Test for Divergence. We evaluate the limit of the terms:
\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n}{\sqrt{n^2+4}} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n}{\sqrt{n^2(1+4/n^2)}} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n}{n\sqrt{1+4/n^2}} \]
\[ = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+4/n^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+0}} = 1 \]
Since $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 1 \neq 0$, the series diverges by the Test for Divergence.
\textbf{Final Answer:} Divergent.

\subsection*{14. For $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{7^{n+1}}{10^n}$, find 10 partial sums, graph, and determine if it converges.}
\textbf{Solution:}
This is a geometric series. We rewrite the term:
\[ a_n = \frac{7^{n+1}}{10^n} = \frac{7 \cdot 7^n}{10^n} = 7 \left(\frac{7}{10}\right)^n \]
The first term is $a = a_1 = 7(7/10) = 49/10$. The common ratio is $r = 7/10$.
Since $|r| = 7/10 < 1$, the series converges.
The sum is $S = \frac{a}{1-r} = \frac{49/10}{1 - 7/10} = \frac{49/10}{3/10} = \frac{49}{3}$.
\textbf{Final Answer:} Convergent, sum is $49/3$.

\subsection*{15. Let $a_n = \frac{2n}{3n+1}$. (a) Determine whether $\{a_n\}$ is convergent. (b) Determine whether $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n$ is convergent.}
\textbf{Solution:}
(a) To determine if the sequence $\{a_n\}$ is convergent, we find its limit.
\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{2n}{3n+1} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{2}{3+1/n} = \frac{2}{3} \]
Since the limit exists and is finite, the sequence $\{a_n\}$ is \textbf{convergent} and converges to $2/3$.

(b) To determine if the series $\sum a_n$ is convergent, we can use the Test for Divergence.
From part (a), we found that $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 2/3$.
Since $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 2/3 \neq 0$, the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n$ is \textbf{divergent} by the Test for Divergence.

\subsection*{16. (a) Explain the difference between $\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i$ and $\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_j$. (b) Explain the difference between $\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} a_i$.}
\textbf{Solution:}
(a) There is no difference. Both expressions represent the sum of the first $n$ terms of the sequence $\{a_k\}$, which is the $n$-th partial sum $s_n$. The index of summation ($i$ or $j$) is a dummy variable; its name does not affect the value of the sum.

(b) $\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i$ is the $n$-th partial sum, which is a finite sum of $n$ terms. Its value depends on $n$. $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} a_i$ is an infinite series, representing the sum of all the terms in the sequence. Its value is a single number, defined as the limit of the partial sums: $\lim_{n \to \infty} \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i\right)$, if the limit exists.

\subsection*{17. $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{n+2} - \frac{1}{n} \right)$}
This is a typo in the book. A telescoping sum is usually of the form $b_{n+k} - b_n$. Let's assume it should be $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+2} \right)$ or similar. Let's solve it as written, which is not a standard telescoping sum.
Let's try to write out the partial sum $s_n$:
$s_n = \left(\frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{1}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{3}\right) + \dots + \left(\frac{1}{n+2} - \frac{1}{n}\right)$
Re-arranging:
$s_n = (-1 - \frac{1}{2}) + (\frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{3}) + (\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{4}) + \dots$
The terms $\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, \dots, \frac{1}{n}$ cancel out.
$s_n = (-1 - \frac{1}{2}) + (\frac{1}{3}+\dots+\frac{1}{n+2}) - (\frac{1}{1}+\dots+\frac{1}{n}) $
Let's write it out more clearly:
$s_n = (\frac{1}{3}-1) + (\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{2}) + (\frac{1}{5}-\frac{1}{3}) + \dots + (\frac{1}{n+1}-\frac{1}{n-1}) + (\frac{1}{n+2}-\frac{1}{n})$
The $+\frac{1}{3}$ cancels the $-\frac{1}{3}$. The $+\frac{1}{4}$ will cancel a $-\frac{1}{4}$ from the next term.
Let's check what terms are left.
The terms that don't cancel are from the beginning and the end.
Beginning: $-1, -1/2$.
End: The positive terms that don't have a negative counterpart are $\frac{1}{n+1}$ and $\frac{1}{n+2}$.
So, $s_n = -1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{n+1} + \frac{1}{n+2}$.
Now we find the sum by taking the limit:
$S = \lim_{n \to \infty} s_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left( -1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{n+1} + \frac{1}{n+2} \right) = -1 - \frac{1}{2} + 0 + 0 = -\frac{3}{2}$.
\textbf{Final Answer:} Convergent, sum is $-3/2$.

\subsection*{18. $\sum_{n=4}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{n+1}} \right)$}
\textbf{Solution:} This is a telescoping series. Let's write out the $N$-th partial sum (starting from $n=4$ up to $N$).
\[ s_N = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{4}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\right) + \dots + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{N+1}}\right) \]
The intermediate terms cancel out.
\[ s_N = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{N+1}} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{N+1}} \]
Now we find the sum by taking the limit as $N \to \infty$.
\[ S = \lim_{N \to \infty} s_N = \lim_{N \to \infty} \left( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{N+1}} \right) = \frac{1}{2} - 0 = \frac{1}{2} \]
\textbf{Final Answer:} Convergent, sum is $1/2$.

\subsection*{19. $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{3}{n(n+3)}$}
\textbf{Solution:} This is a series we can solve using partial fractions, which will reveal a telescoping sum.
\[ \frac{3}{n(n+3)} = \frac{A}{n} + \frac{B}{n+3} \implies 3 = A(n+3) + Bn \]
If $n=0$, $3 = 3A \implies A=1$.
If $n=-3$, $3 = -3B \implies B=-1$.
So, $a_n = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+3}$.
Let's write out the partial sum $s_n$:
\[ s_n = \left(1 - \frac{1}{4}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{5}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{6}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{7}\right) + \dots \]
\[ \dots + \left(\frac{1}{n-2} - \frac{1}{n+1}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{n-1} - \frac{1}{n+2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+3}\right) \]
The $-1/4$ cancels with the $+1/4$. The positive terms that are left at the beginning are $1, 1/2, 1/3$. The negative terms left at the end are $-1/(n+1), -1/(n+2), -1/(n+3)$.
\[ s_n = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{n+1} - \frac{1}{n+2} - \frac{1}{n+3} \]
Now take the limit:
\[ S = \lim_{n \to \infty} s_n = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} - 0 - 0 - 0 = \frac{6+3+2}{6} = \frac{11}{6} \]
\textbf{Final Answer:} Convergent, sum is $11/6$.

    \item \textbf{Geometric Series (e.g., Problems 11, 14, 23-32, 35, 36, 39, 40, ...):} These are the most common type.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Identification:} The general term $a_n$ contains a number raised to the power of $n$, like $r^n$.
            \item \textbf{General Approach:} Algebraically manipulate $a_n$ into the standard form $ar^{n-1}$ or $ar^n$. Identify the first term $a$ (by plugging in the starting value of $n$) and the common ratio $r$. If $|r| < 1$, the series converges to $S = \frac{a}{1-r}$. If $|r| \ge 1$, it diverges.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Test for Divergence (e.g., Problems 12, 13, 15b, 38, 41, 45, 47, 49, 50):} This is the first test you should always apply.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Identification:} Use this for any series. It's most effective when the terms $a_n$ clearly do not go to zero (e.g., rational functions where numerator degree $\ge$ denominator degree, or oscillating functions).
            \item \textbf{General Approach:} Calculate $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n$. If the limit is anything other than 0 (including DNE), the series diverges. If the limit is 0, this test is inconclusive.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Telescoping Series (e.g., Problems 17-22, 92):} These series have terms that cancel each other out.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Identification:} The term $a_n$ is a difference, or can be rewritten as a difference, like $a_n = b_n - b_{n+k}$. Often involves rational functions that can be decomposed with partial fractions, or logarithms.
            \item \textbf{General Approach:} Write out the $n$-th partial sum, $s_n$. Observe the pattern of cancellation. Identify the few terms at the beginning and end that do not cancel. Take the limit $\lim_{n \to \infty} s_n$ to find the sum.
        \end{itemize}
     \item \textbf{Application Problems (e.g., 51, 53-58, 71-76):} These problems model real-world scenarios or mathematical concepts using series.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Identification:} Word problems involving repeating processes, long-term behavior, or repeating decimals.
            \item \textbf{General Approach:} Translate the problem into a series. In most cases in this section, it will be a geometric series. Identify $a$ and $r$ from the context of the problem and use the appropriate formula.
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Key Algebraic and Calculus Manipulations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Rewriting for Geometric Series:} This was crucial in problems like 39: $\sum 3^{n+1}4^{-n}$.
    \[ 3^{n+1}4^{-n} = 3 \cdot 3^n \cdot (1/4)^n = 3 \cdot (3/4)^n \]
    From this form, we can identify $r=3/4$ and calculate the first term $a = 3(3/4)^1 = 9/4$. This algebraic step is necessary to apply the geometric series formula.
    \item \textbf{Partial Fraction Decomposition:} This was the key to solving telescoping series like Problem 19, $\sum \frac{3}{n(n+3)}$.
    \[ \frac{3}{n(n+3)} = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+3} \]
    This decomposition transformed an unmanageable sum into a telescoping series where most terms canceled, making it possible to find the limit of the partial sums.
    \item \textbf{Limit of a Sequence:} The Test for Divergence relies entirely on evaluating $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n$. For Problem 13, $\sum \frac{n}{\sqrt{n^2+4}}$, we had to use the technique of dividing by the highest power of $n$ in the denominator.
    \[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n}{\sqrt{n^2+4}} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n/n}{\sqrt{n^2+4}/n} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+4/n^2}} = 1 \]
    This calculus skill was essential to prove divergence.
    \item \textbf{Finding $a_n$ from $s_n$:} In Problem 69, we were given $s_n$ and asked for $a_n$. The required manipulation is the formula $a_n = s_n - s_{n-1}$ for $n>1$.
    \item \textbf{Properties of Logarithms:} In Problem 20, $\sum \ln(\frac{n}{n+1})$, using the property $\ln(a/b) = \ln(a) - \ln(b)$ transformed the term into $\ln(n) - \ln(n+1)$, immediately revealing it as a telescoping series.
\end{itemize}

\section{"Cheatsheet" and Tips for Success}
\subsection{Core Formulas}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Geometric Series Sum:} For $\sum ar^{n-1}$, if $|r|<1$, then $S = \frac{a}{1-r}$.
    \item \textbf{Test for Divergence:} If $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n \neq 0$, the series $\sum a_n$ diverges.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tricks and Shortcuts}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Divergence Test First:} Always check $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n$ first. It's often the quickest way to determine divergence.
    \item \textbf{Identify the Type:} Look at the form of $a_n$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $r^n \implies$ Geometric.
            \item Rational function $\implies$ Try Divergence Test or Partial Fractions (Telescoping).
            \item $\ln(\dots) \implies$ Likely telescoping.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Be Careful with `a`:} The first term `a` in the geometric series formula is the actual first term of your series, which depends on the starting index. For $\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} (1/2)^n$, the first term is $a = (1/2)^2 = 1/4$, not $1/2$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Common Pitfalls and Mistakes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Misusing the Divergence Test:} The most common mistake. If $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 0$, you can conclude \textbf{nothing} about convergence. The test is inconclusive.
    \item \textbf{Forgetting to Check $|r| < 1$:} Do not apply the geometric series sum formula unless you have verified that the condition $|r| < 1$ is met.
    \item \textbf{Algebra Errors:} Mistakes in partial fractions or manipulating exponents are frequent. Double-check your algebra.
    \item \textbf{Telescoping Cancellation:} When writing out $s_n$ for a telescoping series, be methodical. Write out enough terms to see the pattern clearly and correctly identify which terms do not cancel.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conceptual Synthesis and The "Big Picture"}
\subsection{Thematic Connections}
The core theme of this topic is **formalizing the concept of an infinite sum through the use of limits.** This is the same fundamental theme that underlies all of calculus.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Connection to Integrals:} A definite integral, $\int_a^b f(x) dx$, is also the limit of a sum (a Riemann sum). Both integrals and series use the machinery of limits to make sense of summing up infinitely many pieces. The difference is that integrals sum over a continuous interval, while series sum over discrete indices.
    \item \textbf{Connection to Limits:} This entire topic is a direct application of the theory of sequence limits from the previous chapter. The convergence of a series is *defined* as the convergence of its sequence of partial sums.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Forward and Backward Links}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Backward Link (Foundation):} The study of \textbf{sequences and their limits} (Chapter 11.1) is the absolute prerequisite. We directly apply the concept of a limit to the sequence of partial sums $\{s_n\}$. Without a rigorous idea of what it means for a sequence to converge, we could not define what it means for a series to converge.
    \item \textbf{Forward Link (Application):} Infinite series are not just a curiosity; they are one of the most powerful tools in higher mathematics. This topic is the bedrock for:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Power Series and Taylor Series:} We will learn to represent complicated functions (like $\sin x$, $e^x$, $\ln x$) as "infinite polynomials" called power series. This is essential for approximating functions, solving differential equations, and evaluating difficult integrals.
            \item \textbf{Fourier Series:} In physics and engineering, functions are often represented as an infinite sum of sine and cosine functions. This is used in signal processing, image compression (like JPEGs), and solving heat flow equations.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Real-World Application and Modeling (Finance Focus)}
\subsection{Concrete Scenarios}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Valuing a Perpetuity (Finance):} A perpetuity is a type of bond or security that pays a fixed amount of money (a coupon, $C$) at regular intervals forever. Its price today, known as its Present Value (PV), is the sum of all future payments, each discounted by an interest rate $r$. This forms an infinite geometric series. The result, $PV = C/r$, is a cornerstone of fixed-income valuation.
    \item \textbf{The Dividend Discount Model (DDM) (Finance):} The intrinsic value of a stock can be modeled as the present value of all of its expected future dividends. In the Gordon Growth Model, dividends are assumed to grow at a constant rate $g$. The stock's price $P_0$ is the sum of the infinite series of discounted future dividends. This results in the formula $P_0 = D_1 / (r-g)$, another direct application of the geometric series sum.
    \item \textbf{The Multiplier Effect (Economics):} As seen in homework problem 75, when the government injects money into the economy, that money is spent, received as income, and then re-spent. Each round of spending is a fraction of the previous round. The total economic impact is the sum of an infinite geometric series, which tells policymakers how a small initial spending package can have a much larger effect on the overall economy.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Model Problem Setup: Dividend Discount Model}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scenario:} An analyst is trying to value a mature company's stock. The company just paid a dividend of \$2.00 per share ($D_0$). The analyst expects this dividend to grow at a stable rate of 3\% per year, forever. The required rate of return for an investment of this risk level (the discount rate) is 8\%. What is the fair price of the stock today ($P_0$)?
    \item \textbf{Model Setup:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Variables:}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Last dividend, $D_0 = \$2.00$
                    \item Growth rate, $g = 0.03$
                    \item Discount rate, $r = 0.08$
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Formulation:} The price is the sum of the present values of all future dividends.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item The dividend in 1 year will be $D_1 = D_0(1+g) = 2(1.03) = \$2.06$. Its PV is $\frac{D_1}{(1+r)^1}$.
                    \item The dividend in 2 years will be $D_2 = D_0(1+g)^2 = 2(1.03)^2$. Its PV is $\frac{D_2}{(1+r)^2}$.
                    \item The dividend in $n$ years will be $D_n = D_0(1+g)^n$. Its PV is $\frac{D_n}{(1+r)^n}$.
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Equation to be Solved:} The stock price is the sum of this infinite series:
            \[ P_0 = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{D_0(1+g)^n}{(1+r)^n} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} D_0 \left( \frac{1+g}{1+r} \right)^n \]
            This is a geometric series.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The first term is $a = D_0 \frac{1+g}{1+r} = 2 \frac{1.03}{1.08}$.
                \item The common ratio is $R = \frac{1+g}{1+r} = \frac{1.03}{1.08}$.
            \end{itemize}
            Since $g<r$, we have $|R|<1$, so the series converges. The sum is given by the formula $S = \frac{a}{1-R}$. In finance, this is simplified to the well-known formula $P_0 = \frac{D_1}{r-g}$.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Common Variations and Untested Concepts}
The provided homework focuses on a few key series types. However, a full understanding requires knowledge of several other convergence tests that were not included.

\subsection{The Integral Test and p-Series}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Concept:} The Integral Test connects the convergence of a series $\sum a_n$ to the convergence of an improper integral $\int_1^\infty f(x) dx$, where $f(n)=a_n$. For this test to apply, $f(x)$ must be continuous, positive, and decreasing.
    \item \textbf{p-Series:} A direct and important consequence of the Integral Test is the rule for \textbf{p-series}. A series of the form $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^p}$ is called a p-series.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item It \textbf{converges} if $p > 1$.
            \item It \textbf{diverges} if $p \le 1$.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Worked Example (Untested Concept):} Determine if the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2}$ converges.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Solution:} This is a p-series with $p=2$. Since $p=2 > 1$, the series \textbf{converges}. (Note: The homework's harmonic series $\sum 1/n$ is a p-series with $p=1$, which diverges).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Comparison Tests}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Concept:} The Comparison Tests allow us to determine the convergence of a series by comparing it to another series whose convergence properties are already known (like a p-series or a geometric series).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Direct Comparison Test:} If $0 \le a_n \le b_n$ and $\sum b_n$ converges, then $\sum a_n$ converges. If $0 \le b_n \le a_n$ and $\sum b_n$ diverges, then $\sum a_n$ diverges.
        \item \textbf{Limit Comparison Test:} If $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n}{b_n} = L$ where $L$ is a finite, positive number, then both series either converge or both diverge.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Worked Example (Untested Concept):} Determine if the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2+5}$ converges.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Solution (Direct Comparison):}
            \item For $n \ge 1$, we know that $n^2+5 > n^2$.
            \item Therefore, $\frac{1}{n^2+5} < \frac{1}{n^2}$.
            \item We know that $\sum \frac{1}{n^2}$ is a convergent p-series ($p=2$).
            \item Since our series has terms that are smaller than the terms of a known convergent series, our series $\sum \frac{1}{n^2+5}$ must also \textbf{converge} by the Direct Comparison Test.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Advanced Diagnostic Testing: "Find the Flaw"}
For each problem below, a flawed solution is presented. Your task is to find the single critical error, explain why it is an error, and provide the correct solution.

\subsection*{Problem 1}
Find the sum of the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 2 \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^n$.

\textbf{Flawed Solution:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item This is a geometric series.
    \item The first term is $a = 2(3/2)^1 = 3$.
    \item The common ratio is $r = 3/2$.
    \item The sum is $S = \frac{a}{1-r} = \frac{3}{1 - 3/2} = \frac{3}{-1/2} = -6$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Problem 2}
Determine if the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}$ (the harmonic series) converges or diverges.

\textbf{Flawed Solution:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We use the Test for Divergence.
    \item We compute the limit of the terms: $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} = 0$.
    \item Since the limit of the terms is 0, the series converges.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Problem 3}
Find the sum of the telescoping series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{n+1} - \frac{1}{n}\right)$.

\textbf{Flawed Solution:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Let's write out the $n$-th partial sum, $s_n$.
    \item $s_n = (\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{1}) + (\frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{2}) + (\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{3}) + \dots + (\frac{1}{n+1} - \frac{1}{n})$.
    \item The terms cancel out, leaving the first term and the last term.
    \item $s_n = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{n}$.
    \item The sum is $S = \lim_{n \to \infty} s_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} (\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{n}) = \frac{1}{2} - 0 = \frac{1}{2}$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Problem 4}
Find the sum of the series $5 - \frac{10}{3} + \frac{20}{9} - \frac{40}{27} + \dots$.

\textbf{Flawed Solution:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item This is a geometric series.
    \item The first term is $a = 5$.
    \item To find the ratio, we divide the second term by the first: $r = \frac{-10/3}{5} = -\frac{2}{3}$.
    \item We check $|r|=|-2/3| < 1$, so the series converges.
    \item The sum is $S = \frac{1-r}{a} = \frac{1 - (-2/3)}{5} = \frac{5/3}{5} = \frac{1}{3}$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Problem 5}
Determine if the series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{4^n - 1}{5^n}$ converges or diverges. If it converges, find its sum.

\textbf{Flawed Solution:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We can rewrite the general term as $a_n = \frac{4^n}{5^n} - \frac{1}{5^n} = (\frac{4}{5})^n - (\frac{1}{5})^n$.
    \item The series can be split: $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (\frac{4}{5})^n - \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (\frac{1}{5})^n$.
    \item The first series is geometric with $a=1, r=4/5$. Sum = $\frac{1}{1-4/5} = 5$.
    \item The second series is geometric with $a=1, r=1/5$. Sum = $\frac{1}{1-1/5} = 5/4$.
    \item The total sum is $5 - 5/4 = 15/4$.
    \item The series converges to $15/4$.
\end{enumerate}
(This solution is actually correct. Let's create a flawed one).

\subsection*{Problem 5 (Revised)}
Determine if the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{n^2+1}{n^2}$ converges or diverges.

\textbf{Flawed Solution:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We can split the series: $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{n^2+1}{n^2} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{n^2}{n^2} + \frac{1}{n^2} \right) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 1 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2}$.
    \item The first series $\sum 1$ diverges.
    \item The second series $\sum 1/n^2$ is a convergent p-series ($p=2$).
    \item Since a divergent series plus a convergent series is divergent, the original series diverges.
\end{enumerate}
(This reasoning is correct. Let's make a flawed reasoning on a different problem).

\subsection*{Problem 5 (Final Version)}
Find the sum of the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^n$.

\textbf{Flawed Solution:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Let's write out the terms: $-1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + \dots$.
    \item We can group the terms like this: $(-1 + 1) + (-1 + 1) + (-1 + 1) + \dots$.
    \item This is a sum of zeros: $0 + 0 + 0 + \dots$.
    \item Therefore, the sum of the series is 0.
\end{enumerate}
